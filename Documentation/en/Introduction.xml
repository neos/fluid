  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>Beer3 is a next-generation templating engine which was engineered with
  several goals in mind:<itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Simplicity</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Flexibility</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Extensibility</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Ease of use</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist></para>

  <para>This templating engine should not be bloated, instead, we try to do it
  "The Zen Way" - you do not need to learn too many things, thus you can
  concentrate getting your things done, while the template engine does the
  rest.</para>

    <title>What does it do?</title>

    <para>In the current MVC system of FLOW3, the View part is currently quite
    low-level. That means, the standard view provides a
    <methodname>render</methodname> method, and nothing more. That makes it
    really difficult to write powerful views, as most designers will not write
    PHP code.</para>

    <para>That is where the Template Engine comes into play: It "lives" inside
    the View, and is controlled by a special
    <classname>TemplateView</classname> which instanciates the Template
    Parser, resolves the template HTML file, etc.</para>
